# jupyter-code-llama
Run Code Llama on a Mac with an M1 chip with Jupyter Lab

# Getting started
1. Download the .ipynb notebook and place it in a new folder on your Mac called 'jupyter_code_llama'
2. Install Jupyter Lab within a virtual environment [instructions here](https://github.com/TrelisResearch/install-guides/blob/main/jupyter-lab-setup.md)
3. Run 'jupter lab'
4. Run all of the cells in the notebook.

> The script requires that you have 'wget' installed on your machine. If you don't, this is best installed using HomeBrew (which is best downloaded from [their website](https://brew.sh/).
