The objective is to score runs by hitting a ball thrown by the opposing team's pitcher with a bat and touching a series of four markers called bases arranged at the corners of a 90-foot square diamond. The team with the most runs at the end of nine innings wins the game.\nHere are some key rules and concepts in baseball:\n1. Pitching: The pitcher throws the ball from a mound at the center of the diamond. The ball must cross the plate within a specific area called the strike zone.\n2. Hitting: The batter tries to hit the ball into play, either by hitting it with the bat or on the ground. The batter can hit the ball in any direction, including to the left or right of the diamond.\n3. Running: Runners can advance around the bases by hitting the ball or on a hit by the batter. Runners can also advance on a walk or a hit by pitch.\n4. Innings: The game is divided into nine innings, with each team getting a turn to bat and field.\n5. Scoring: Runs are scored by crossing home plate. A run is scored when a runner reaches home plate safely.\n6. Stealing: Runners can try to steal bases by running to the next base before the ball is thrown to the next batter.\n7. Fielding: The fielding team tries to get the ball and throw it to the appropriate base before the runner reaches the base.\n8. Umpires: The\n",

The North African crested porcupine (M. t. tigrina) is considered the rarest porcupine species, with a population of only around 500 individuals. (Source: IUCN Red List)\n2. The Malayan porcupine (M. t. amygdala) is another rare species, found only in Malaysia and Thailand. Its population is estimated to be around 1,000 individuals. (Source: IUCN Red List)\n3. Rare porcupines are often threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation due to deforestation and urbanization. (Source: WWF)\n4. Porcupines are known to be solitary animals, but they can sometimes be found in pairs or small groups. (Source: National Geographic)\n5. Porcupines have a unique way of communicating with each other through a variety of clicks, whistles, and grunts. (Source: BBC Earth)\n6. Porcupines have a special gland near their tail that produces a musky scent, which they use to mark their territory and warn other animals to stay away. (Source: Animalia)\n7. Porcupines are herbivores and feed on a variety of plants, including leaves, fruits, and bark. (Source: The Spruce Pets)\n8. Porcupines have a unique defense mechanism - their quills can be raised and lowered at will, allowing them to protect themselves from predators without harming themselves. (\n",
